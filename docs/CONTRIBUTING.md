## Branch Naming Criteria: 
Steps to create a branch:
1. Create the appropriate issue for your corresponding task. 
2. Go to the task and under "Development" , click on "Create a new branch".
3. Copy and paste the code into git terminal

The branch should be named: branch#-task-task#-taskname

## Commit Messages Criteria: 
Commits should start with a verb and detail the changes made to the code. 

## Pull Request Review Criteria: 
Since the main branch is protected, one member must review and approve the changes before any other branch can be merged to main. 

When reviewing a pull request:
- Ensure that no dependencies or packages have been altered
- Ensure that there are no conflicts
- Ensure that only the assigned files have been changed
- Ensure that the changes follow the documentation and coding standards
- Locally test code before approving the changes
