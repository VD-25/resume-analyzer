    "jobDescription": "Lead the design, development, and implementation of scalable software systems for planetary navigation and interstellar communication. Collaborate with cross-functional teams including astronauts, astrophysicists, and AI researchers to deliver high-quality solutions that push the boundaries of space exploration. Write clean, maintainable code that will withstand the test of time (or at least the vacuum of space). Participate in code reviews and mentor junior engineers, helping them develop their coding skills to infinity and beyond. Contribute to our open-source projects, including the creation of a universal software framework for Mars rovers and space station management. Create and maintain detailed technical documentation to support interplanetary development standards. Debug and optimize code to achieve minimal latency in real-time space communications, even when signals are transmitted from across the Milky Way. Stay ahead of emerging technologies and contribute to innovative concepts that could shape the future of space exploration. Required Skills and Qualifications: Bachelor's degree (or higher) in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Astrophysics, or a related field. Master's or PhD is a bonus if you’ve also built a working teleportation device. Minimum 5 years of professional software development experience (preferably with experience coding in a zero-gravity environment). Proficiency in at least two programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, or QuantumScript (our proprietary language for quantum computing). Experience with cloud computing platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or equivalent), and have an understanding of how to make code run in outer space. Expertise in building highly available and fault-tolerant distributed systems that can survive a solar flare or two. Deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and interplanetary data transmission protocols. Excellent debugging skills and the ability to troubleshoot complex issues across multiple environments (terrestrial and extraterrestrial). Familiarity with space systems software like NASA’s Open MCT or SpaceX's FalconXOS (or equivalent). Strong communication skills—ability to convey technical concepts to astronauts, engineers, and AI assistants alike. Preferred Qualifications: Previous experience working on software that is currently in orbit or was built with Martian soil in mind. Knowledge of blockchain applications in space-based finance (MarsCoin, anyone?). A working knowledge of the Higgs Boson and its potential uses in computational algorithms. Contributions to space-related open-source projects or software recognized by space agencies or extraterrestrial life."
